# Xenotransplantation Impact Projection Model ðŸ«€

## Overview
This project provides an interactive model for projecting the potential impact of xenotransplantation (animal-to-human organ transplantation) on saving lives over the next several decades. The model considers facility scaling, cost dynamics, regional distribution, and health outcomes to provide comprehensive projections.

## Live Demo
[Link to your Streamlit app once deployed]

## Features
- **Interactive Projections**: Adjust key parameters and see results in real-time
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Compare conservative, moderate, and aggressive growth scenarios
- **Regional Analysis**: View impact distribution across different geographical regions
- **Cost Modeling**: Track cost trajectories with learning curve effects
- **Health Impact**: Calculate lives saved and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
- **Data Export**: Download projection data for further analysis

## Model Components

### Core Parameters
- Initial facility count and capacity
- Growth rate scenarios
- Procedure success rates
- Learning rate for cost reduction
- Regional distribution factors

### Key Metrics
- Annual and cumulative lives saved
- Cost per procedure over time
- Regional distribution of impact
- Required investment
- Cost per QALY
- Facility scaling trajectory

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Local Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jobiajulu/xenomodel.git
cd xenomodel

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app locally
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Usage

### Running the Model
1. Visit the deployed Streamlit app
2. Adjust parameters in the sidebar:
   - Select growth scenario
   - Set projection timeframe
   - Modify facility parameters
   - Adjust cost factors
3. View results in real-time across multiple visualizations
4. Download data for further analysis

### Parameter Definitions

#### Growth Scenarios
- **Conservative**: 20% year-over-year growth
- **Moderate**: 40% year-over-year growth
- **Aggressive**: 60% year-over-year growth

#### Cost Parameters
- **Facility Construction**: Capital cost for new production facility
- **Facility Operation**: Annual operating costs
- **Organ Processing**: Per-organ processing cost
- **Training**: Surgical team training costs

#### Health Impact
- **Success Rate**: Procedure success probability
- **Quality of Life**: Post-transplant quality of life adjustments
- **Survival Rates**: Mortality rate adjustments

## Model Methodology

### Facility Scaling
The model uses a compound growth approach with initial slow growth during regulatory approval and early adoption phases, followed by accelerated scaling based on the selected scenario.

```python
# Example scaling calculation
annual_supply = facilities * capacity * utilization_rate
facilities *= growth_rate[scenario]
```

### Cost Learning Curve
Implements Wright's Law for cost reduction through learning effects:
```python
unit_cost = base_cost * (cumulative_production ** log2(learning_rate))
```

### Health Impact Calculation
Combines survival probability with quality of life adjustments:
```python
qalys = survival_probability * qol_multiplier * years
```
